            <div class="desc">The amount of Chia that a farmer can earn is proportional 
                to the percentage of the network that they own. For example 
                a farmer that owns 0.25% of the total network space can expect to win 0.25% of the blocks.

                        <p>
                            As the total size of the Chia networkâ„¢ grows it becomes
                             increasingly difficult to earn Chia as a solo farmer.

                        <p>
                            When the network space reaches 1 EB a farmer with 10 TB of space
                             would own 0.00001% of the network and can expect to wait over 20 days to win 
                             a single block. If they are unlucky they could easily be waiting several months. 
                            Somebody with less than 10 TB of space could be waiting a lot longer.
                        </p>

                            By joining a pool a farmer can start earning a small amount of Chia much quicker because 
                            the total space of the pool determines the chance of winning a block.
